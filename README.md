# Space Robotics Training Program
Hello and welcome to Module 10 and 11 of the Training Programme! In this module, you will learn about robot modelling and simulation technologies such as URDF, Xacro and Gazebo. This repository contains all of the codes used in these modules. Feel free to clone this package into your workspace. But before you run any of these codes, make sure you have the dependencies installed. To install the dependencies, copy and paste the following command in your terminal:

```
sudo apt install python3-wstool python3-catkin-tools \
	ros-noetic-joint-state-controller  \
	ros-noetic-effort-controllers  \
	ros-noetic-joint-trajectory-controller  \
	ros-noetic-position-controllers  \
	ros-noetic-velocity-controllers  \
	ros-noetic-rviz  \
	ros-noetic-rqt
```
This is what you will be making:
